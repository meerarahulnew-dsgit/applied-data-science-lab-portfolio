# Applied Data Science Lab Portfolio
📌 Project Overview

The Applied Data Science Lab Portfolio is a teaching-oriented project designed to support undergraduate data science laboratory instruction.
It demonstrates the end-to-end data science workflow through structured lab modules suitable for Computer Science and Data Science programs.

This repository is developed as a lab instruction reference and a project-based learning model.

🎯 Educational Objectives

This project enables students to:

Understand data science methodologies and best practices

Perform data acquisition, cleaning, and preprocessing

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Apply machine learning algorithms for data analysis

Create meaningful visualizations and dashboards

Interpret results and communicate insights effectively

🧩 Project Scope & Workflow

The project follows a complete data science lifecycle:
